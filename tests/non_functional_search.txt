### NOTES ###
This file is provided as a .txt to demonstrate planned test scenarios and automation approach.
Tests are expected to fail because the functionality is not yet implemented or behaves differently than expected,
(e.g. the application returns results for injection payloads).
The keywords and structure show how these tests would be executed with screenshots captured for verification.
Once the features are available, this can be converted into a runnable .robot file.
